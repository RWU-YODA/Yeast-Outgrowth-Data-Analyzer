  <p>The Yeast Outgrowth Data Analyzer (YODA) bioinformatic tool calculates relative viability of yeast strains using outgrowth curves.<sup>1</sup> Outgrowth curves can be generated using one of several commercially available robotic incubator/shaker/plate readers, by recording optical density at A600 (OD<sub>A600</sub>) of yeast growth over a 24-hour period. Relative viability is calculated based on the time-shift at which the outgrowth curve reaches a determined OD<sub>A600</sub> using the formula outlined in the below figure, where <strong>v<sub>n</sub></strong> is the relative viability, <strong>&#8710t<sub>n</sub></strong> is the shift in time (in minutes) between the reference and experimental strain, and <strong>&#8706</strong> is the doubling time of the strain (calculated as the maximal slope of the semi-log plot of OD<sub>A600</sub> as a function of time). The YODA tool is useful for assaying the chronological life span of yeast<sup>2</sup>, as well as the relative viability of strains following drug treatment (e.g., stress resistance). We and others have used OD<sub>A600</sub> set to 0.2 to calculate <strong>&#8710t<sub>n</sub></strong>, but the tool is flexible to allow users to change this value based on their own experimental set up. </p>
